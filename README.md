# Vending_Machine
This project implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) based vending machine in Verilog. It accepts ₹1 and ₹2 coins, tracks the total inserted amount, and dispenses an item when ₹5 is reached. The design includes a testbench for simulation and VCD file generation for waveform analysis in GTKWave.
